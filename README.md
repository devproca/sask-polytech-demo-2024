## Spring Boot
Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies creating Java applications by handling common setup tasks and configuration.

### Demo
Create REST endpoint to find all characters in the database and create a character in the database.

### Definitions
* **REST** - (Representational State Transfer) is a way to design web services that allow applications to communicate over the internet. It uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with resources, often represented in JSON. REST is simple, scalable, and stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process that request.


## Angular
Angular is a development platform built on typescript. It includes a component-based framework for building scalable web applications and a collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication.

### Demo
Using the table created in the Tailwind exercise, dynamically generate table entries by looping over a JSON object. Then, retrieve the entries from the Spring Boot application developed in the previous step.
